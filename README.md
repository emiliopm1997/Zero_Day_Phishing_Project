## ðŸ§  Project Overview

**ZDPD** is a research-driven Python package designed to detect **zero-day phishing attacks** using a combination of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **reconstruction-based models**. This project focuses on identifying malicious emails that evade traditional signature-based detection by analyzing semantic anomalies in email content.

The goal is to contribute to proactive cybersecurity by catching novel phishing attempts in real-time, without relying on blacklists or manually engineered rules.

- NLP pipelines using libraries like SpaCy and NLTK
- Transformer-based feature extraction (BERT)
- Reconstruction models (PCA, autoencoders) for anomaly detection
- Model training, evaluation, and zero-day simulation workflows
